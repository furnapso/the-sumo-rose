# The Sumo Rose - Restaurant Page Project
## Technologies used
* npm
* webpack
* CSS
* Javascript
* HTML
  
## Thoughts
Having not had anything to do with HTML, JS or CSS since 2012, wrapping my head around the current state of web development in 2020 has been incredibly interesting. Things like webpack blow my mind - the ingenuinity of the open source community to solve common problems is really imppressive.

Aside from learning npm and webpack, this was a fairly straight forward project.
